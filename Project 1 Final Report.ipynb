'Paperless Billing' contains 2 values,i.e, 'Yes' or 'No'.Likewise, there are 4 values in the 'Payment Method' column, they are, 'Electronic check', 'Mailed check', 'Bank transfer (automatic), and 'Credit Card'. 'Monthly Charges' column also has numerical value.

This indicates churned customers tend to have higher monthly charges on average.\n",

    "   There could be other factors influencing churn that are not included in the model. These might include customer service quality, contract terms, competitive offers, individual customer preferences, market conditions, and more. The dataset might not be representative of the broader population or might not capture enough historical context to adequately model the churn behavior in terms of monthly charges relationship with churn rate.\n",
    "   While the R-squared value gives an indication of the strength of the relationship, it would also be important to consider the p-value associated with the regression analysis to understand whether the observed relationship is statistically significant.\n",
    "- **With respect to Internet Services Categories:**\n",
    " One relevant factor here that may be affecting churn rate is, Fiber Optic which has the most churn rate,i.e, 42% which is 1297 counts of churns out of 3096 total Fiber optic customers, as shown in my analysis above. This rate suggests issues around fiber optic services driving churn, or customers getting fiber, expecting faster speeds but being disappointed.The provider could focus on improving fiber optic performance and customer satisfaction to reduce the high churn. Overall, internet service type seems correlated with likelihood to churn. Improving fiber optic satisfaction and analyzing the root causes of dissatisfaction among fiber optic customers could reveal ways to improve retention.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **With respect to Contract categories**:\n",
    "  Another variable that is notably strong factor here is month-to-month contract. As shown in our analysis above,month-to-month contract has the highest churn rate. Approximately 42.71% of customers with a month-to-month contract have churned. Whereas customers with longer contracts (one year and two years) have significantly lower churn rates, with the two-year contract holders being the least likely to churn(2.83%).\n",
    "  Highest month-to-month churn rate could reflect a lowest commitment level or satisfaction with the service.\n",
    "Other reasons why month to month contract has the highest churn could be, such as unaffordability of services for longer period, end of promotions and trial periods, life changes etc.    \n",
    "- **With respect to “Total Charges:”** The significant presence of outliers among churned customers suggests that while the median total charge is lower, several churned customers still have very high total charges. The absence of outliers in the retained customer box plot suggests a more uniform distribution of total charges without extreme values. Since churned customers have a more comprehensive range of total charges with outliers indicating some high values, the business might want to investigate why customers with high total charges are leaving and address those reasons to improve retention.\n",
    "The more consistent range of total charges among retained customers could indicate that customers within a specific range of spending are more likely to stay, which could be a sign of stable usage patterns and satisfaction with the service among these customers, possibly because they find the services to be of good value or due to the costs associated with switching to another provider, or lack of a better alternative.\n",
    "- **With Respect to “Senior Citizen”:** The churn rate is almost double for senior citizens versus non-seniors (41.68% >23.60%) even though seniors are only 16.2% of the total customers in the dataset. The smaller number of senior citizens in the dataset could mean we didn’t collect enough data from the senior citizen population. At the same time, their higher churning rate suggests that they may need additional retention efforts, special offers, or customized services to reduce their churn rate.\n",
